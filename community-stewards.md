# ⛑ Community Stewards

The Code of Conduct stewards are responsible for maintaining the Code of Conduct, managing discussions about additions and subtractions, and interpreting the Code of Conduct in related discussions.

The initial stewards consist of members of the ITP/IMA community responsible for drafting this Code of Conduct drawn from organizing members of Tech & Society and the ITP/IMA Equitability Working Group. The stewards have made a commitment for the academic year 2020-2021. In addition to maintaining the Code of Conduct during this period, they will be responsible for developing a plan for regularly rotating stewards. The stewards primary responsibility is to maintain this Code of Conduct in order to make sure it continues to reflect the ITP/IMA community’s values.

This year’s stewards are:

## Tech & Society

Ashley Jane Lewis, Lydia Jessup, Verónica Alfaro Arias, Mary Notari

## ITP/IMA Equitability Working Group

Blair Simmons, Daniel Shiffman, David Rios
