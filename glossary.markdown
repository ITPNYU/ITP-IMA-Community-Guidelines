## Terms

<br>
<br>

---

## <a name="queer">Queer</a>
Originally a derogatory slur, it has been reclaimed by some to be an inclusive term for those within LGBTQ+ communities. Some individuals claim this identity to recognize the fluidity of sexual attraction and/or gender identity. For many, this is a political identity in resistance to heteronormativity and anything beyond straight/cis. This term is not always seen as inclusive of trans communities, therefore, we commonly refer to our communities as “queer AND trans communities.”

## <a name="transgender">Transgender</a>
An umbrella term that describes many gender identities for people who do not identify with their sex assigned at birth; the term transgender is not indicative of gender expression, sexual orientation, and/or physical anatomy. Trans identity may shift throughout a lifetime.
