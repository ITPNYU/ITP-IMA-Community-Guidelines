## Community Stewards ✨

The Community Guidelines stewards are responsible for maintaining the Community Guidelines, managing discussions about additions and subtractions, and interpreting the Community Guidelines in related discussions.

The initial stewards consist of members of the ITP/IMA community responsible for drafting this Community Guidelines drawn from organizing members of Tech & Society and the ITP/IMA Equitability Working Group. The stewards have made a commitment for the academic year 2020-2021. In addition to maintaining the Community Guidelines during this period, they will be responsible for developing a plan for regularly rotating stewards. The stewards primary responsibility is to maintain this Community Guidelines in order to make sure it continues to reflect the ITP/IMA community’s values.

## This year’s stewards are:

### Tech & Society

Ashley Jane Lewis, Lydia Jessup, Mary Notari, Verónica Alfaro Arias

### ITP/IMA Equitability Working Group

Blair Simmons, Daniel Shiffman, David Rios, Luisa Pereira, Matt Romein, Sarah Rothberg
