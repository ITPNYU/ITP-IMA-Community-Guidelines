# ðŸ’œ Facilitation and Getting Help

As we are individually responsible for upholding ethical standards of learning and making, we are also responsible for holding ourselves and each other accountable. Voicing concerns and addressing issues is part of how we keep each other safe, foster open communication, and strive to grow and learn as a community.  

We recognize that violations -- whether of this code of conduct, or of other institutional, personal, or professional standards -- can take many forms. Violations can come from any community member and be experienced by any community member (including but not limited to interactions between students and faculty or the reverse, faculty and faculty, staff and students, faculty and staff, and various interactions of our community with guests inside and/or outside of the classroom, in physical and digital spaces. 

In the event of any unresolved dispute, conflict, or code of conduct violation, we encourage community members to take any or all of the following actions: 

## Report to the NYU Bias Response Line:
The NYU Bias Response Line provides a mechanism through which members of the NYU community can share or report experiences and concerns of bias, discrimination, or harassing behavior that may occur within our community.

Experienced administrators in the Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO) receive and assess reports, and then help facilitate responses, which may include referral to another University school or unit, or investigation if warranted according to the University's existing Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy.

The Bias Response Line is designed to enable the University to provide an open forum that helps to ensure that our community is equitable and inclusive.

## Sexual Misconduct and Title IX

Tisch School of the Arts is dedicated to providing its students with a learning environment that is rigorous, respectful, supportive and nurturing so that they can engage in the free exchange of ideas and commit themselves fully to the study of their discipline. To that end Tisch is committed to enforcing University policies prohibiting all forms of sexual misconduct as well as discrimination on the basis of sex and gender. 

Detailed information regarding these policies and the resources that are available to students through the Title IX office can be found by using the following links:

Form submissions will be read by the following members from the ITP/IMA Equitability group:

In cases where name and email are provided, someone from the group will reach out to continue the conversation and assist with next steps.  Anonymous submissions can be logged but unfortunately can not be responded to.

Any of the group members can also be reached individually by email, or collectively at: equitable@itp.nyu.edu
