# Development of Code of Conduct

The ITP/IMA Code of Conduct is an ever-evolving document that establishes and communicates the commitment of the ITP/IMA community to uphold a key set of standards and obligations that aim to make ITP/IMA a friendly and welcoming environment to be a part of.

## **Developing and Growing the Code of Conduct**

This Code of Conduct is collaboratively developed by the ITP/IMA community. This first draft was co-written by ITP faculty and students and emerged from discussions during Tech & Society lunch sessions. The document is based on other community statements and code of conducts listed in the attributions at the end. 

Contributors to this initial first draft include Ashley Jane Lewis, Lydia Jessup, Mary Notari, Verónica Alfaro Arias, Blair Simmons, Daniel Shiffman, David Rios. Contributors to the second draft include Sarah Rothberg, Luisa Pereira and Matt Romein.

- Second, elements will be clarified through interpretation. The Code of Conduct is made up of high level principles that may apply differently to each ITP/IMA community space and project. We intend to add interpretations to the Code of Conduct as we make them. We hope that this will add context to the principles over time.
