# Mediation and Facilitation

As we are responsible for upholding ethical standards of learning and making, we are also responsible for holding ourselves and each other accountable to ethical social and behavioral standards. Voicing concerns and addressing issues is part of how we foster safe spaces, embrace dialogue, and continue to grow and learn as a community.

We recognize that code of conduct violations can take many forms, (sometimes people are unaware of their behavior). We recognize, violations can come from any community member to any community member (including but not limited to, student to student, faculty to student, student to faculty, faculty to faculty, staff to student, student to staff, faculty to staff, staff to faculty including faculty, staff, students, and guests), inside and/or outside of the classroom, in physical and digital spaces.

In the event of a code of conduct violation, unresolved dispute, or conflict, or a code of conduct violation, or code of conduct suggestion, ,community members should voice concern or log issues report violations in the following ways.

- *Fill out the reporting form [[Link to anonymous google form]](https://forms.gle/P2x1KmwWXaXAc4Jw5)*
- *Or contact [Incl. 3 contact email addresses]*

When a violation is reported, it will be reviewed by no fewer than three members of the Steering Committee which will take the following actions:

- *Reply to the violation to acknowledge receipt (unless anonymous) offering support and availability to discuss further.*
- *When appropriate, mediate a conversation between parties.*
- *When appropriate, request mediation or assistance from the Tisch Assistant Dean of Diversity’s office.*
- *When appropriate, make a recommendation for resolution to ITP/IMA Chair.*
- *In cases of anonymous reports we will log the issue and keep a record.*

Sometimes, participants violating the Code of Conduct are unaware that their behavior is harmful, and an open conversation clears things up to move forward.

The above reporting process is not a replacement for the university’s bias response system and community members are encouraged to also make use of the following services:
