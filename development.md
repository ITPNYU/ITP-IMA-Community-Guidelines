## <a name="development">🚧 Development of Community Guidelines</a>

The ITP/IMA Community Guidelines is an evolving document that establishes and communicates the commitment of the ITP/IMA community to uphold a key set of standards and obligations that aim to make ITP/IMA an inclusive and welcoming environment.

## Developing and Growing the Community Guidelines

This Community Guidelines is collaboratively developed by the ITP/IMA community. This first draft was co-written by ITP faculty and students and emerged from discussions during Tech & Society lunch sessions. The document is based on other community statements and Community Guidelines listed in the attributions at the end.

Contributors to this initial first draft include Ashley Jane Lewis, Lydia Jessup, Mary Notari, Verónica Alfaro Arias, Blair Simmons, Daniel Shiffman, David Rios. Contributors to the second draft include Sarah Rothberg, Luisa Pereira and Matt Romein.

The website was originally designed and developed by Themis Garcia.

The Community Guidelines are currently maintained by the ITP/IMA Faculty Equitable Committee: Blair Simmons, Daniel Shiffman, David Rios, Sarah Rothberg, Sharon De La Cruz.

We expect the Community Guidelines to be an evolving document. This evolution will take at least two forms.

- First, the elements may change. Some rules may be added, while others may be removed.

- Second, elements will be clarified through interpretation. The Community Guidelines is made up of high level principles that may apply differently to each ITP/IMA community space and project. We intend to add interpretations to the Community Guidelines as we make them. We hope that this will add context to the principles over time.

In addition to the Community Guidelines itself, when considering the development of creative computing applications, we recommend a further [Reading List](reading-list.md) which highlights key texts on ethics and technology.
