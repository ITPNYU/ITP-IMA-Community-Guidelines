## <a name="development">üöß Development of Code of Conduct</a>

The ITP/IMA Code of Conduct is an evolving document that establishes and communicates the commitment of the ITP/IMA community to uphold a key set of standards and obligations that aim to make ITP/IMA an inclusive and welcoming environment.

## Developing and Growing the Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct is collaboratively developed by the ITP/IMA community. This first draft was co-written by ITP faculty and students and emerged from discussions during Tech & Society lunch sessions. The document is based on other community statements and code of conducts listed in the attributions at the end.

Contributors to this initial first draft include Ashley Jane Lewis, Lydia Jessup, Mary Notari, Ver√≥nica Alfaro Arias, Blair Simmons, Daniel Shiffman, David Rios. Contributors to the second draft include Sarah Rothberg, Luisa Pereira and Matt Romein.

We expect the Code of Conduct to be an evolving document. This evolution will take at least two forms.

- First, the elements may change. Some rules may be added, while others may be removed.
- Second, elements will be clarified through interpretation. The Code of Conduct is made up of high level principles that may apply differently to each ITP/IMA community space and project. We intend to add interpretations to the Code of Conduct as we make them. We hope that this will add context to the principles over time.

In addition to the Code of Conduct itself, when considering the development of creative computing applications, we recommend a further [Reading List](reading-list.md) which highlights key texts on ethics and technology.
