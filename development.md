## <a name="development">üöß Development of Community Commitments</a>

The ITP/IMA Community Commitments is an evolving document that establishes and communicates the commitment of the ITP/IMA community to uphold a key set of standards and obligations that aim to make ITP/IMA an inclusive and welcoming environment.

## Developing and Growing the Community Commitments

This Community Commitments is collaboratively developed by the ITP/IMA community. This first draft was co-written by ITP faculty and students and emerged from discussions during Tech & Society lunch sessions. The document is based on other community statements and Community Commitmentss listed in the attributions at the end.

Contributors to this initial first draft include Ashley Jane Lewis, Lydia Jessup, Mary Notari, Ver√≥nica Alfaro Arias, Blair Simmons, Daniel Shiffman, David Rios. Contributors to the second draft include Sarah Rothberg, Luisa Pereira and Matt Romein.

We expect the Community Commitments to be an evolving document. This evolution will take at least two forms.

- First, the elements may change. Some rules may be added, while others may be removed.
- Second, elements will be clarified through interpretation. The Community Commitments is made up of high level principles that may apply differently to each ITP/IMA community space and project. We intend to add interpretations to the Community Commitments as we make them. We hope that this will add context to the principles over time.

In addition to the Community Commitments itself, when considering the development of creative computing applications, we recommend a further [Reading List](reading-list.md) which highlights key texts on ethics and technology.
