## Welcome to the ITP/IMA Community Guidelines!

We warmly invite all ITP/IMA community members to read and understand the <mark><a href="community_statement">Community Guidelines</a></mark>!

The ITP/IMA Community Guidelines is an evolving **work-in-progress** document that establishes and communicates the commitment of the ITP/IMA community to uphold a key set of standards and obligations that aim to make ITP/IMA an inclusive and welcoming environment.

The Community Guidelines is open to revisions, clarifications, and reconsideration. For more information on how the Community Guidelines came to be, who was involved, and how you can get involved check out the Community Guidelines Development <mark><a href="development">Community Guidelines Development</a></mark>. For questions or suggestions, contact <a href="mailto:equitable@itp.nyu.edu">equitable@itp.nyu.edu</a>.

Many terms, concepts, and words in this Community Guidelines may be new or unfamiliar. Please refer to the <mark><a href="glossary">Glossary</a></mark> for clarification of meaning. Certain words may be highlighted in the Community Guidelines with definitions in order to assist with comprehensibility.

**This project follows the <mark><a href="https://github.com/ITPNYU/ITP-IMA-Community-Guidelines" target="_blank">all-contributors</a></mark> specification.**
