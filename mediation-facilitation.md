# ðŸ’œ Facilitation / Getting Help

As we are individually responsible for upholding ethical standards of learning and making, we are also responsible for holding ourselves and each other accountable. Voicing concerns and addressing issues is part of how we keep each other safe, foster open communication, and strive to grow and learn as a community.  

We recognize that violations -- whether of this code of conduct, or of other institutional, personal, or professional standards -- can take many forms. Violations can come from any community member and be experienced by any community member (including but not limited to interactions between students and faculty or the reverse, faculty and faculty, staff and students, faculty and staff, and various interactions of our community with guests inside and/or outside of the classroom, in physical and digital spaces. 

In the event of any dispute, conflict, or code of conduct violation, we encourage community members to log and record these issues in order to help us maintain a record of the challenges we face and help to insure appropriate action both in the short and long term. 

To facilitate recording â€” whether anonymous or not -- within our own community, we have created the following form, and we encourage our community members to use it, regardless of whether they have sought resolution through other means:
